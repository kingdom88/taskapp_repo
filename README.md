# PHP Task management tool By Kingdom Lwandle
# Info: This is a task/todo list written in PHP.   It uses a JSON text file for the tasks, and the visual side is created with the HTML5 Kickstart framework by Joshua Gatcke.  
# Install:  Download and Unzip the file and upload to the web-directory (public_html, /var/www/, /srv/httpd etc..) and make sure that the webserver can write to the json file (chown www-data:www-data task.json or chmow 777 task.json).
# Benefits: of using php and Json together.  - No ads - Nobody selling your data - Nobody monitoring your activity - Data is easy to get out (no vendor lock-in) and to backup. - Offline mode? Host it on your local machine with a LAMP/WAMP/MAMP server.
# Features - Add/Close/Cancel/Update tasks - Due date on tasks, time left/late shown. - No database required
